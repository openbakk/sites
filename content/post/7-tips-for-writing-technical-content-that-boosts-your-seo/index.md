**If you want to get the best possible SEO results, you need to create content that’s not only popular with your users, but also full of what search engines like Google want to see**. This isn’t an easy feat to accomplish, especially if you’re writing technical content that requires more than just a basic knowledge of your subject matter. That’s why we’ve put together this list of seven important tips for writing technical content that’s optimized for search engines([Moz](https://moz.com/community/q/user/seopack-orgfgfg)).

## Write for humans

1. When you're [writing technical content](https://www.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-answers/technical-seo/), always keep your audience in [mind](https://allincode.mystrikingly.com/). Write for humans first and foremost, and worry [about keywords](https://www.semrush.com/blog/learning-technical-seo/) second. 
2. That said, don't forget to include relevant keywords throughout your content. But don't stuff them in; use them naturally and sparingly. 
3. Make your [content easy to read](https://yoast.com/what-is-technical-seo/) and understand. Use short sentences and simple words whenever possible. 
4. Breaking up your [text with headings](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur154554049/), lists, and images can also help make it [more digestible](https://tinyurl.com/2p8n8x2f). 
5. Keep your [content updated](https://tinyurl.com/4rs7rvxd) regularly. Outdated information can hurt your [SEO ranking](https://github.com/openbakk/zippa/wiki/7-Simple-SEO-Hacks-to-Boost-Your-Traffic), so it's important to keep things fresh.

## Keep titles short and descriptions longer

![seo technical](seo-technical.jpg "Seo Technical")

1. Keep your [titles short](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/technical-seo/) and sweet. The average reader only spends a few seconds scanning [your title](https://linktr.ee/capslifept), so make sure it’s clear and concise. 
2. Write meta descriptions that pack a punch. Your [meta description](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fbecaps.life&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH2aQ5sDZG6JIo9ESgYn7jxjpXCeQ) is the [short blurb](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-maintenance-checklist-crucial-daily-monthly-quarterly-yearly-tasks/293759/) that appears under your title in the [search results](https://ahrefs.com/blog/technical-seo/). This is your chance to sell readers on clicking through to your content, so make it count!
3. Use keyword-rich phrases. When it comes to [technical SEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dh78Rbhcxw0), using the right keywords is essential. Do your research to find out which [keywords](https://www.blogger.com/profile/13228709933209589966) are most relevant to your [audience](https://www.blogger.com/profile/17008315374007249316) and [sprinkle](https://www.blogger.com/profile/17927685191117085118) them throughout your content.
4. [Structure your posts](https://ahrefs.com/blog/technical-seo/) with [headings and subheadings](https://www.behance.net/gallery/148423169/Ways-to-Use-Social-Media-to-Boost-Your-Website-Traffic).

## LSI keywords are your friend

[LSI keywords](<https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2020/08/27/lsi-keywords#:~:text=In%20terms%20of%20SEO%20(search,what%20your%20content%20is%20about.>) are simply words and phrases related to your [main keyword](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/technical-seo-guide). By including them in your content, you can [signal](https://www.reliablesoft.net/technical-seo/) to Google that your content is relevant and informative. This, in turn, can help **[boost your SEO](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbecaps.life)**. Here are seven tips for incorporating LSI keywords into your [technical content](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide).

## Write useful meta descriptions

1. Keep your [meta descriptions](https://www.becaps.life/becaps) short and sweet - under 155 characters is ideal.
2. Write [unique description](https://www.becaps.life/corporativo) for each page on your website - don't just copy and paste the same one across [your site](https://profile.hatena.ne.jp/webtrafficseo/).
3. Use [keyword-rich](https://www.msn.com/nl-nl/news/trending/topicsearch?q=site:becaps.life&form=PRNTTH&mkt=nl-nl&httpsmsn=1&sp=-1&pq=site:becaps.life&sc=6-24&qs=n&sk=) phrases in your meta descriptions to [help improve](https://edex.adobe.com/community/member/5PXRACNN_) your chances of [ranking in search results](https://neilpatel.com/blog/technical-seo-site-audit/).
4. Make sure your meta descriptions are relevant to the content on the page they're [describing](https://unamo.com/blog/seo/technical-seo).
5. Use active [voice](https://cognitiveseo.com/blog/17963/technical-seo-checklist/) in your meta descriptions whenever possible.
6. Try to avoid using superlatives like best or greatest - let your content speak for [itself](https://web.mit.edu/course/21/21.guide/toc.htm).

### Proofread, proofread, proofread!

One of the most important things you can do when [writing technical content](https://blog.becaps.life/about-heidi-cullen/) is to proofread [your work](https://blog.becaps.life/about-wendy-schmidt/). Not only does this ensure that your content is error-free, but it also helps to [improve your SEO](https://searchengineland.com/guide/seo/content-search-engine-ranking). Here are a few tips to help you [proofread your work](https://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/16052-high-quality-seo-factors.html).

### Determine your keyword density target

One of the most important things to consider when writing technical content is your target [keyword density](https://bit.ly/396NMn3). This is the number of times your target keywords should appear in your content in order for it to be effective. Generally, a good rule of thumb is to aim for a keyword density of 2-5%. This means that if you're writing a 100-word piece of content, your target keywords should appear 2-5 times.

### Add related internal links

Internal links are important for two reasons: they [help search engines](https://github.com/openbakk/) understand your website’s structure and they can also help improve your website’s ranking in search results. 

When you’re writing technical content, be sure to include [internal links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lemonick) to other [relevant pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Schmidt) on your website. This will help search engines better understand your [website’s structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Cullen) and it will also give readers the opportunity to explore [more](https://resultadosdigitais.com.br/o-que-e-seo/#:~:text=SEO%20%C3%A9%20a%20sigla%20de,outros%20buscadores%2C%20gerando%20tr%C3%A1fego%20org%C3%A2nico.) of your website’s content. 

Here are a [few tips](https://www.searchmetrics.com/de/glossar/suchmaschinenoptimierung/) to keep in mind when you’re writing technical content: 

Use keyword-rich anchor text: When you’re [linking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) to other pages on your website, be sure to use keywords in the [anchor text](https://rockcontent.com/blog/what-is-seo/).
